# Weekly Coding Report 99

### January 07, 2017
Reorganized my _Coding Personal Curriculum_ for work I want to complete before PCA and Hack Reactor onsite.

Hack Reactor Prep
 * Outlining and stubbing
 * Testing/Assertio
 * TDD
 * TDD Exercises

Asked someone on Slack who went to Dev Bootcamp for good resources for Hack Reactor

> Hey! Here are some additional resources that should aid you in being successful during and after bootcamp:

> HTML & CSS:
Learn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe:
http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

> Javascript:
Head First Javascript Programming:
https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X

> You Don’t Know JS Book Series:
https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

> SQL:
Head First SQL
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QNDJZI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1

> Node:
I’m making an assumption here that this is probably the server side language they will teach you since Hack Reactor is a JS bootcamp, but I would fact check that first.

> Coding Problems:
Free code camp:
The site has several basic, intermediate, and advance algorithm scripting problems

> Hacker Rank:
This site also has several algorithmic type problems you can work on

> Blogs:
I would also look up blogs written by Hack Reactor students. They generally have very detailed information about what they learned during the project. Which can help you get a leg in terms of preparing. I liked this blog: http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/archives/

> However, it was written in 2013 so I would look up a more updated one also.

> Frameworks:
** I would first get really comfortable with understanding Javascript fundamentals, then become literate in a JS framework.** I’m not that crazy about these resources, but it’s a starting point. If you find better one’s please let me know.

> Angular:

> React:

> Good luck!

Hack Reactor Prep  

  Testing assert PASS/FAIL template using ES6 template literals:
  ```
  return `PASSED [${testName}]`;
  return `FAILED [${testName}] - Expected "${expected}", but got "${actual}"`;
  ```
