## CHANGE IS HARD
### Weekly Coding Report #99
### January 07, 2017

Reorganized my _Coding Personal Curriculum_ for work I want to complete before PCA and Hack Reactor onsite.

Hack Reactor Prep
 - Outlining and stubbing
 - Testing/Assertio
 - TDD
 - TDD Exercises
 - Quick simple testing assert PASS/FAIL message template using ES6 template literals:
 
   ```javascript
   return `PASSED [${testName}]`;
   return `FAILED [${testName}] - Expected "${expected}", but got "${actual}"`;
   ```
 - Should a test be made that is meant to not pass or is negative?

Asked someone on Slack who went to Dev Bootcamp for good resources for Hack Reactor. She said:

> Hey! Here are some additional resources that should aid you in being successful during and after bootcamp:

> HTML & CSS:

> [Learn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

> Javascript:

> [Head First Javascript Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X)

> [You Don’t Know JS Book Series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

> SQL:

> [Head First SQL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006QNDJZI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

> Node:

> I’m making an assumption here that this is probably the server side language they will teach you since Hack Reactor is a JS bootcamp, but I would fact check that first.
http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-node-js-completely-and-with-confidence/

> Coding Problems:

> [Free Code Camp](www.freecodecamp.com) - The site has several basic, intermediate, and advance algorithm scripting problems

> [Hacker Rank](www.hackerrank.com):
This site also has several algorithmic type problems you can work on

> Blogs:

> I would also look up blogs written by Hack Reactor students. They generally have very detailed information about what they learned during the project. Which can help you get a leg in terms of preparing. I liked [this blog]( http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/archives/).

> However, it was written in 2013 so I would look up a more updated one also.

> Frameworks:

> **I would first get really comfortable with understanding Javascript fundamentals, then become literate in a JS framework.** I’m not that crazy about these resources, but it’s a starting point. If you find better one’s please let me know.

> Angular:

> https://thinkster.io/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs

> React:

> https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/

> Good luck!

Free Code Camp Toy Problems

- Hack Reactor prep site went down so I switched to FCC algorithm 'Wherefore Art Thou'
- I am weak at Objects and completely understanding how to search for their keys/props.
- I understand the solution and my logic was exactly correct.
- I am trying to never use a for loop like this again:
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
```
- Now that I think I understand it, I have to recall and do it again FROM SCRATCH. It's the **only** way to really beat something into my skull and learn.

Hack Reactor Prep
 - Module 2 Exercises
  - Average integers
  - Decorate student list with ages
  - Is it an isogram?
  - Find first word with most repeated characters
  
      Their solution split out finding the max value in a hash map  
      My tests are more rigourous. Theirs will fail if a character is uppercase.  
      I should strive to have each function I write do **ONE THING ONLY**!
    
  - Render phone number
  - Find longest palindrome
 - Here's a quick checklist of how I should approach each problem.
  - [ ] Understand the problem first
  - [ ] Outline and skeleton
  - [ ] Think of test cases
  - [ ] Write assert for those tests
  - [ ] Create tests ==RED==
  - [ ] Develop main function(s)
  - [ ] Make tests pass ==GREEN==
 - I still need more work on Objects, Prototypes and Constructors. I must understand them deeply.

Free Code Camp Intermediate Algorithms - **COMPLETED**

- DNA Pairing (switch statements ever worth using?)
- Wherefore Art Thou
- Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
- Sum All Odd Primes (learned how to implement Sieve of Eratosthenes!)
- Smallest Common Multiple (damn math research for GCD and LCM)
- Finders Keepers
- Drop it!
- Steamroller
- Binary Agents
- Everything Be True
- Arguments Optional

Finishing up a lot of stuff in my last week of work so I didn't get much done today since I was in at 7AM and reached home at 8PM.

Hack Reactor Pre-course Slack channel was opened and I joined in. Exciting!

This useful tool was already shared by instructor Albrey: [http://explainshell.com/](http://explainshell.com/)

Google Calendar also all setup and ready to go.

Another cool article shared with me about engineers and notebooks: [Software Engineers Should Keep Lab Notebooks](https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/05/software-and-lab-notebooks/)

Few good posts on Deep Work:

1. [Deep Work: A welcome kick in the butt.](https://cpbotha.net/2017/01/09/deep-work-a-welcome-kick-in-the-butt/)
2. [Quantifying and Visualizing “Deep Work”](https://medium.com/@FILWD/quantifying-and-visualizing-deep-work-af4689a62423#.3h2xlvpy7)
